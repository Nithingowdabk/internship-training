Hi, I'm Nithin Gowda B K, a final-year AI & ML student passionate about automation and AI-driven solutions. I've worked on projects like 'Village Seva,' an AI-based chatbot for government schemes, and a sign language detection system using OpenCV. I have experience organizing college events, including a hackathon, and I'm skilled in Python, machine learning, and IoT. I'm also interested in surveillance systems, agro-tech automation, and live camera access solutions. Beyond tech, I enjoy hiking and exploring new places. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities that align with my passion for AI and automation.
